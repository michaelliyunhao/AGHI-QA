# AGHI-QA: A Subjective-Aligned Dataset and Metric for AI-Generated Human Images
## [Paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.21308) | [Dataset](https://huggingface.co/datasets/chris-123/AGHI-QA)


We introduce AGHI-QA, the first large-scale benchmark specifically designed for quality assessment of AGHIs. The dataset comprises 4,000 images generated from 400 carefully crafted text prompts using 10 state of-the-art T2I models. We conduct a systematic subjective study to collect multidimensional annotations, including perceptual quality scores, text-image correspondence scores, visible and distorted body part labels. Based on AGHI-QA, we evaluate the strengths and weaknesses of current T2I methods in generating human images from multiple dimensions.
